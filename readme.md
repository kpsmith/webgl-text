# WebGL text rendering

Creates character images from a Canvas source, then places them into a 3d pane for text rending.
Can type characters forward, no deletion.
Words wrap lines but there is no control character support (\n, \t, etc.)

## Example
Showing state after typing lowercase alphabet.
